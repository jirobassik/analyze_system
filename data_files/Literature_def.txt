Literature is any collection of written work, but it is also used more narrowly for writings
specifically considered to be an art form, especially prose, fiction, drama, poetry, and including
both print and digital writing. In recent centuries, the definition has expanded to include oral literature,
also known as orature much of which has been transcribed. Literature is a method of recording, preserving,
and transmitting knowledge and entertainment, and can also have a social, psychological, spiritual, or political role.
