1. Literary Fiction. Literary fiction novels are considered works with artistic value and literary merit.
They often include political criticism, social commentary, and reflections on humanity.
Literary fiction novels are typically character-driven, as opposed to being plot-driven,
and follow a character’s inner story. Learn more about writing fiction in James Patterson’s MasterClass.
2. Mystery. Mystery novels, also called detective fiction, follow a detective solving a case from start to finish.
They drop clues and slowly reveal information, turning the reader into a detective trying to solve the case, too.
Mystery novels start with an exciting hook, keep readers interested with suspenseful pacing,
and end with a satisfying conclusion that answers all of the reader’s outstanding questions.
3. Thriller. Thriller novels are dark, mysterious, and suspenseful plot-driven stories.
They very seldom include comedic elements, but what they lack in humor, they make up for in suspense.
Thrillers keep readers on their toes and use plot twists, red herrings,
and cliffhangers to keep them guessing until the end. Learn how to write your own thriller in Dan Brown’s MasterClass.
4. Horror. Horror novels are meant to scare, startle, shock, and even repulse readers.
Generally focusing on themes of death, demons, evil spirits, and the afterlife, they prey on fears with scary
beings like ghosts, vampires, werewolves, witches, and monsters. In horror fiction, plot and characters are tools
used to elicit a terrifying sense of dread. R.L. Stine’s MasterClass teaches tips and tricks for horror writing.
5. Historical. Historical fiction novels take place in the past. Written with a careful balance of research and
creativity, they transport readers to another time and place—which can be real, imagined, or a combination of both.
Many historical novels tell stories that involve actual historical figures or historical events within historical settings.
