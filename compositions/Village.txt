Description of My Village
My village exists in a low lying area that has a warm summer and a chilly winter. Mostly I visit my village in summers because of the holidays. Although the village is far cooler than the city during the summer. Also, you do not need air conditioners in a village because of the breeze. In a village you see greenery and almost every household has a minimum of one tree in their courtyards.
Moreover, summer is a season of harvest so I have rarely seen any crops. Besides, earlier there was to be more kutcha house (houses made of mud and bricks) but now the scenario has changed and the number of pakka house (made up of concrete and other material) has increased. Also, the people of the village are friendlier than the people of the cities.
